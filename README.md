# Solar_System_SImulator_General_Relativity
This is a some code creating a Solar System Simulator using The Geodesic Equations, Christoffell Symbols, and The Schwartzchild Metic in General Relativity. This is a really exciting project for me and I coded this in Python. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
