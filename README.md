# Solar_System_SImulator_General_Relativity
This is a some code creating a Solar System Simulator using The Geodesic Equations, Christoffell Symbols, and The Schwartzchild Metic in General Relativity. This is a really exciting project for me and I coded this in Python.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. 

I have also included another Solar System Simulator which uses Boyer-Lindquist Coordinates and using 
the Kerr Metric. On a physics level, the Schwartzchild Metric involves looking at non-rotating uncharged black holes and the Kerr Metric describes black holes having spin. 


Just for fun, I have included code representing the three body system simulation. I hope you enjoy reading that as well. This piece of code in still in the making.
